# rsc-suspense-patterns

This is a simple demo project that shows how user interfaces feel when using React Server Components and different types of technique for rendering and suspense with pages with slow data fetches.

Run it yourself by cloning this repo and running `npm start dev`, or take a look at the live demo of the project running at https://rsc-suspense-patterns.edspencer.net/ (it's just this repo deployed to Vercel, so if it's gone the way of the dinosaurs by the time you read this, you know how to get it back).

See my blog post on the topic at https://edspencer.net/2024/06/18/understanding-react-server-components-and-suspense/ - this repo was created as a visual aid to that post.
